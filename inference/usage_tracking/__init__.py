In order to enable Roboflow to perform our business functions
we need to be able to measure how our deployments are used.

Users who don't use API key and who don't use premium or enterprise workflow blocks
can turn the telemetry off by setting TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT environment variable to True.

Please consult the license for more information regarding when telemetry cannot be turned off.
