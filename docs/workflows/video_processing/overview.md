# Video Processing with Workflows

We've begun our journey into video processing using Workflows. Over time, we've expanded the number of 
video-specific blocks (e.g., the ByteTracker block) and continue to dedicate efforts toward improving 
their performance and robustness. The current state of this work is as follows:
