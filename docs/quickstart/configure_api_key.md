To use Inference, you will need a Roboflow API key.

If you don't already have a Roboflow account, [sign up for a free Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com). 

Then, retrieve your API key from the Roboflow dashboard. [Learn how to retrieve your API key](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).

You should export your API key in your coding environment in a variable called `API_KEY`:

```
export API_KEY=<your api key>
```

Once you have exported your API key, you can use Inference to run models on images, videos, and live streams.
